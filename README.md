# Deep Learning  - Tweet-sentiment-Analysis project


This is the final solution of the project 'Deployment' which consists in deploying a Sentiment Analysis model using RNN for Tweet Sentiment Analysis. The notebook and Python files provided here result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on COVID related Tweets.

In the final architecture AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions is used as well. The application architecture diagram is:

## Web app final result

The final project will be executed in a simple html page which can be deployed anywhere. 
I've deployed it on IBM Cloud
