# Deep Learning  - Tweet-sentiment-Analysis project


This is the final solution of the project 'Deployment' which consists in deploying a Sentiment Analysis model using RNN for Tweet Sentiment Analysis. The notebook and Python files provided here result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on COVID related Tweets.

In the final architecture AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions is used as well. The application architecture diagram is:

# General Outline

Step 1: Downloading the data
Step 2: Preparing and Processing the data
Step 3: Upload the data
Step 4: Build and Train the PyTorch Model
Step 5: Testing the Model
Step 6: Deploying the model for testing
Step 7: Use the model for testing
Step 6 Deploy the model for the web app
Step 7 Use the model for the web app


## Web app final result

The final project will be executed in a simple html page which can be deployed anywhere. 
I've deployed it on IBM Cloud

and Soon I will explain my project with a video.

NOTE - I've also used AWS because IBM cloud services such as powerful GPU instances were not available for my projects since I'm a Student free tier limited user.
